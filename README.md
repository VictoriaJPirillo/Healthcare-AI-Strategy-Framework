# Healthcare AI Strategy Framework

## AI Governance Approach by Victoria Pirillo

### Overview
A strategic framework for AI governance in healthcare organizations, bridging the gap between AI technical capabilities and healthcare operational realities.

### Framework Components
- **Clinical Validation**: Ensuring AI outputs meet healthcare context requirements
- **Compliance Integration**: Built-in regulatory and HIPAA considerations  
- **Equity Monitoring**: Proactive bias detection using healthcare domain knowledge
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Translating AI capabilities into clinical value propositions

### Key Applications
- **IVR Systems**: Phone routing with clinical urgency considerations
- **Clinical Cases**: AI applications with regulatory compliance oversight
- **Prior Authorization**: Cost optimization balanced with patient access
- **Pharmacy Operations**: AI governance for medication management workflows

### What Makes This Different
This framework is built from healthcare operations experience, focusing on:
- Real-world implementation challenges in healthcare environments
- Regulatory compliance integrated from day one, not retrofitted
- Cross-functional stakeholder management in clinical settings
- Sustainable AI adoption that healthcare teams actually use
